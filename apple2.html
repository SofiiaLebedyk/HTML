                            <h2>The M2 MacBook Air </h2>
        <p>Apple in June 2022 introduced an updated and redesigned MacBook Air that offers the biggest design overhaul to the MacBook Air line since 2010, and the first use of the M2 chip.

        The 2022 MacBook Air looks entirely different from the previous-generation version, featuring an updated chassis that does away with the tapered design that the MacBook Air used for so long. Instead, the MacBook Air adopts a uniform, flat body similar to the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Air is 11.3mm thick, making it a bit thinner than the prior-generation MacBook Air, and it weighs 2.7 pounds. It is just about the same size as the prior-generation model at 11.97 inches wide and 8.46 inches tall.

        Thin black bezels surround an updated 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display that supports 1 billion colors and features 500 nits brightness, making it 25 percent brighter than before.
        
        There is a notch at the front of the MacBook Air display, which allows for more screen space around the updated 1080p FaceTime HD camera. Apple added a built-in four-speaker sound system that supports spatial audio and wide stereo. It also features a three-microphone array.
        
        The MacBook Air comes in Silver, Space Gray, Starlight, and Midnight, the latter of which is a new dark blue shade that's almost black. The MacBook Air continues to feature a black keyboard with Touch ID and a large Force Touch trackpad.</p>
